# whatuthinking
a personal blog that will showcase my experiences as a bootcamp student at the university of Minnesota. 
Working with JS, CSS and HTML I was able to develop a website that will allow me to make posts about things that i might find interesting. the design is simple but very easy to understand. it also offers the posibility to switch bettween dark and light mode.
